### Generative AI Usage Declaration

As part of the development of this app, I have made limited, responsible use of generative AI tools for code generation, debugging, documentation, and design guidance. All AI-generated content has been reviewed, tested, and adapted to ensure it aligns with the assignment requirements and Monash University’s academic integrity standards.

**Tools used:**
- **ChatGPT (o4-mini-high)** via OpenAI API  
  Assisted with algorithm design, Kotlin/Compose code snippets, and troubleshooting logic issues.
- **Claude Sonnet 4** via Anthropic API  
  Consulted for high-level design discussions, best-practice recommendations, and conceptual clarifications.
- **Microsoft Copilot** in VS Code / Android Studio  
  Generated boilerplate code, refactored functions, and offered inline suggestions during implementation.

**How AI was used:**
1. **Scaffolding & Examples**  
   Generated initial Compose UI layouts, Retrofit service interfaces, and ViewModel boilerplate.
2. **Debugging & Optimization**  
   Identified logical errors (e.g., null-safety, coroutine timing) and suggested corrective patterns.
3. **Documentation & Learning**  
   Drafted README sections (including this declaration), in-code comments, and explanatory notes.

**Academic integrity & validation:**
- All AI-generated code and prose have been carefully reviewed, tested, and, where necessary, refactored or rewritten to ensure full understanding and alignment with unit learning outcomes.
- No AI tool was used to complete assessments in a way that would constitute unauthorized collaboration or plagiarism.
- I remain solely responsible for the correctness, design decisions, and final submission of this assignment.
