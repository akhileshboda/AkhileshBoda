# Akhilesh's IT Portfolio | Cybersecurity, Software, Systems Development
Hi, and welcome to my repository!

**About Me**

Iâ€™m a passionate Information Technology student at Monash University, majoring in Cybersecurity with minors in Software, Web, and Mobile Applications Development. My journey in technology has been shaped by a strong enthusiasm for software development, cybersecurity, and project management, and I aspire to lead innovative teams as a Project Manager and/or Scrum Master in the future.

Since graduating from high school in 2018, Iâ€™ve explored various aspects of IT, honing my technical skills while embracing the principles of agile development and secure systems design. In 2025, I aim to further specialize in cybersecurity while working on software development projects that challenge and expand my skill set.

**Projects & Learning**

I am constantly building and refining my technical abilities through both coursework and personal projects. Some of my key projects include:

WAM Grade Calculator (Java) â€“ A tool to calculate Weighted Average Marks (WAM) for university courses.

More projects coming soon!

I am also passionate about agile methodologies, software architecture, and developing secure applications, continuously seeking opportunities to improve and apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.

**Beyond IT**

Outside of technology, I am an active competitive natural bodybuilder, with achievements including state-level contention and a top-3 national placement. This discipline has instilled in me a strong work ethic, resilience, and a goal-oriented mindset, qualities I bring to both my personal and professional endeavors.
