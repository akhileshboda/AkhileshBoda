# Akhilesh's IT Portfolio | Cybersecurity, Mobile Applications/Web Development, Project Management
Hi, and welcome to my repository!

## Profile

Iâ€™m a passionate Information Technology student at Monash University, majoring in Cybersecurity with minors in Web and Mobile Applications Development. My journey in technology has been shaped by a strong enthusiasm for software development, cybersecurity, and project management, and I aspire to lead innovative teams as a Project Manager and/or Scrum Master in the future.

Since undetaking my studies in 2023, I have been privileged to explore and immerse myself in the various domains of IT, allowing me to cultivate my technical skills while igniting my passion in agile development and secure systems design. In 2025, I aim to further hone my abilities in cybersecurity while working on software development projects that challenge and expand my skillset.

## Projects & Learning

I am constantly building and refining my technical abilities through both coursework and personal projects. In my repository, you will find my previous and current works in project managmenet and UI/UX design in addtion to some of my key projects including:

- **NutriTrack v1** - An early design of a nutritional companion to improve food literacy for a pre-registered user.

### Upcoming
- **NutrTrack v2 - Advanced** *(in progress)*  - Extends functionality upon NutriTrack v1 by refactoring into MVVM, integrating Google Gemini and integrateing a Clinican view.
- **WAM Calculator and Course Planner (AI Powered)** - A personalised Android study companion app that tracks university performance (WAM/GPA) and offers AI-powered unit recommendations aligned with your academic interests and career goals.
- **Personal Portfolio Website** - A full-stack personal portfolio website built with the MERN stack to showcase my projects, resume, and development skills as an IT student.

More projects coming soon!

I am also passionate about agile methodologies, software architecture, and developing secure applications, continuously seeking opportunities to improve and apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Beyond IT

Outside of technology, I am an active competitive natural bodybuilder, with achievements including state-level contention and a top-3 national placement. This discipline has instilled in me a strong work ethic, resilience, and a goal-oriented mindset, qualities I bring to both my personal and professional endeavors.
