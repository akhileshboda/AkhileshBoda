Hi, welcome to my repository!

My name's Akhilesh, I am a passionate Information Technology student at Monash University, majoring in both Software Development and Cybersecurity. My journey since graduating from high school in 2018 has enabled me to discover and cultivate an eager enthusiasm for the technology sector and my ambition to become full stack developer. I believe this path will eventually guide me to what I hope is the becoming of a Project Manager.

In 2024, I have applied the concepts from my studies thus far into developing a descriptiving personal website using HTML as the framework and further enhancing it with CSS and JavaScript. Additionally, as a portfolio project I have combined a major hobby of mine, fitness and bodybuilding, with Java to create a fitness app.
